Student Management System using Windows Forms and Local SQL database

When the application is run a list of Students are displayed to the user in a grid format. 
The software allows users to enter details relating to a new Student in addition to updating existing students and 
removing a student from the system. 
The system provides a means to serialise the details of a specific Student into an XML format.
The user is able to View Database history of actions. (Trigger was used to implement this.)
